# Claude-Codex Coordination Log

This is an append-only, chronological record shared by Claude and Codex. New entries go at the end. Sensitive values are replaced with `[REDACTED]`.

## 2026-09-06T11:50:39+05:30 - Codex - CHECKPOINT START

- User prompt (redacted): "PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN: Claude-Codex Transparent Coordination" followed by the complete coordination, behavior, verification, and assumption requirements. No credentials or secrets were present.
- Intended action: Create the shared instructions and append-only coordination log, verify them, commit the checkpoint, and push it to the private remote.
- Checkpoint owner: Codex
- Previous checkpoint commit: `21d104b`
- Files examined: Git status/history and repository filenames
- Files changed: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `COORDINATION_LOG.md`
- Commands and tests:
  - `rg -n "Sandisk|coordination|Claude|Codex" "C:\Users\saini\.codex\memories\MEMORY.md"` -> PASS (exit code 0); checked prior workflow guidance before repository work
  - `git status --short --branch; git log -5 --oneline --decorate; rg --files -g "AGENTS.md" -g "CLAUDE.md" -g "COORDINATION_LOG.md"` -> PASS WITH NOTE (combined exit code 1); Git was clean at `21d104b`, and `rg` returned 1 because none of the coordination files existed
  - `Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssK"` -> PASS (exit code 0); produced the entry timestamp
- Result: PASS (checkpoint started; verification pending)
- Important output/error: Repository was clean and synchronized with `origin/main`; no existing coordination files could be overwritten.
- Base commit: `21d104b`
- Checkpoint commit: Pending checkpoint verification
- Blocker/handoff: None; Codex retains checkpoint ownership.

## 2026-09-06T11:50:39+05:30 - Codex - SIMULATION

- User prompt (redacted): "Simulation only: demonstrate a no-code Codex coordination entry."
- Intended action: Demonstrate the required format without executing commands or changing code.
- Checkpoint owner: Codex (simulation only)
- Previous checkpoint commit: `21d104b`
- Files examined: N/A
- Files changed: N/A
- Commands and tests:
  - `N/A` -> SKIPPED (exit code N/A); simulation intentionally executes nothing
- Result: SKIPPED
- Important output/error: This entry is a format simulation, not an actual agent run.
- Base commit: `21d104b`
- Checkpoint commit: N/A (simulation only)
- Blocker/handoff: Simulated handoff to Claude; no real ownership change.

## 2026-09-06T11:50:39+05:30 - Claude - SIMULATION

- User prompt (redacted): "Simulation only: demonstrate a no-code Claude coordination entry."
- Intended action: Demonstrate the same required format without claiming Claude executed anything.
- Checkpoint owner: Claude (simulation only)
- Previous checkpoint commit: `21d104b`
- Files examined: N/A
- Files changed: N/A
- Commands and tests:
  - `N/A` -> SKIPPED (exit code N/A); simulation intentionally executes nothing
- Result: SKIPPED
- Important output/error: This entry is a format simulation only; Claude did not execute this checkpoint.
- Base commit: `21d104b`
- Checkpoint commit: N/A (simulation only)
- Blocker/handoff: Simulated handoff to Codex; Codex remains the real checkpoint owner.

## 2026-09-06T11:51:44+05:30 - Codex - CHECKPOINT CLOSE

- User prompt (redacted): "PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN: Claude-Codex Transparent Coordination" followed by the complete coordination, behavior, verification, and assumption requirements. No credentials or secrets were present.
- Intended action: Close the documentation checkpoint after confirming the shared protocol, log structure, Git state, and staged-content safety.
- Checkpoint owner: Codex
- Previous checkpoint commit: `21d104b`
- Files examined: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `COORDINATION_LOG.md`, staged Git diff, Git status
- Files changed: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `COORDINATION_LOG.md`
- Commands and tests:
  - `$agent = Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath .\AGENTS.md; $claude = Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath .\CLAUDE.md; $agentShared = $agent.Substring($agent.IndexOf('## Shared Coordination Protocol')); $claudeShared = $claude.Substring($claude.IndexOf('## Shared Coordination Protocol')); if ($agentShared -cne $claudeShared) { Write-Error 'Shared protocol sections differ'; exit 1 }; git diff --stat; Select-String -Path .\COORDINATION_LOG.md -Pattern '^## ' | ForEach-Object { $_.Line }` -> PASS (exit code 0); protocol sections matched byte-for-byte and headings were chronological
  - `git add -- AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md COORDINATION_LOG.md; git diff --cached --check; git status --short --branch; <required-field check>; <staged credential-pattern scan>` -> PASS (exit code 0); only the three requested files were staged, all required fields were present, and no credential-like value was found
  - Project code/model tests -> SKIPPED (exit code N/A); this checkpoint changes documentation only and cannot affect executable behavior
- Result: PASS
- Important output/error: Git emitted expected LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings on Windows; no validation error occurred.
- Base commit: `21d104b`
- Checkpoint commit: Pending; the next chronological entry must record the resulting hash, and `git log -- COORDINATION_LOG.md` is the authoritative receipt.
- Blocker/handoff: After commit and push, checkpoint ownership becomes unassigned. Claude should read this entry and Git status before beginning work.
